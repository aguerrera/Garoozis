Garoozis let's you publish static HTML files using F# and Razor Templates.
==========================================================================

Use this tool for simple website hosting. With it you can
* create static html pages by transforming markdown or html with Razor templates
* copy these static files to Windows Azure Blob storage

This is kind of like [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), but more for .NET.

** THIS IS VERY EARLY STAGE. USE JEKYLL IF YOU NEED SOMETHING LIKE IT **
